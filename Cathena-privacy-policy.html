        <h1>Cathena App Privacy Policy</h1>
    </div>

    <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

    <p>This Privacy Policy describes how <strong>Cathena</strong> ("we," "our," or "us") collects, uses, and discloses information when you use our Cathena mobile application (the "App") and the services provided through the App. By using the App, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

    <p><strong>Cathena is designed to respect your privacy.</strong> We do not automatically collect personal information such as your name, email, or your cat's profile details simply by using the App. <strong>Information is only collected when you actively choose to use specific AI-powered features.</strong></p>

    <h3>Information You Actively Submit for AI Features:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>When using AI Insight (Growth Journal):</strong> You may input text descriptions of your cat's daily events or upload photos. This text and image data is sent to our servers to generate AI feedback and suggestions.</li>
        <li><strong>When using AI Assistant (Knowledge Q&A, Health Guidance):</strong> You submit text queries (questions or descriptions of symptoms/behaviors) to receive AI-generated responses.</li>
        <li><strong>When using Creative Studio (e.g., Cat ID Photo Generator):</strong> You upload photos of your cat. These images are sent to our servers for AI processing and generation of the desired content.</li>
        <li><strong>No other personal information beyond what is directly submitted for these AI features is collected.</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Information Collected Automatically (Usage Data):</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> We may collect non-identifying information about the device you use to access the App, including device model, operating system version, and unique device identifiers. This helps us ensure App compatibility and performance.</li>
        <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> We collect anonymized data about how you interact with the App, such as features accessed, number of AI requests made (without storing the content of those requests unless specifically submitted for processing), and general app usage patterns. This data helps us improve the App's functionality and user experience without identifying you personally.</li>
        <li><strong>Log Data:</strong> When you access the App, our servers may automatically record technical information that your device sends, such as your IP address and device's request time. This data is used for app maintenance and security.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Information from Third-Party AI Services:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The App utilizes third-party AI models (e.g., large language models for text generation, image generation models) to power features like AI Assistant and Creative Studio. When you use these features, <strong>your explicitly submitted input (e.g., text queries, uploaded images) is processed by these third-party services.</strong> We implement measures to protect your privacy when interacting with these services as described below.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>

    <p>We use the information we collect solely for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>To Fulfill Your AI Requests:</strong> To process your submitted text and images through our AI Assistant (e.g., answering questions, providing health guidance) and Creative Studio (e.g., generating cat ID photos) as explicitly requested by you.</li>
        <li><strong>To Provide AI-Driven Insights:</strong> To analyze your submitted journal entries and photos via AI Insight to offer personalized feedback and suggestions for your cat.</li>
        <li><strong>To Improve and Develop the App:</strong> To understand how users interact with the AI features (e.g., frequency of use) and general app performance, to identify trends, fix bugs, and develop new features. This data is primarily anonymized usage data.</li>
        <li><strong>For Security and Fraud Prevention:</strong> To protect the security and integrity of the App.</li>
        <li><strong>To Comply with Legal Obligations:</strong> To meet legal and regulatory requirements.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. How We Share Your Information</h2>

    <p>We may share your information only in the following limited circumstances:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>With Third-Party AI Service Providers:</strong> Your explicitly submitted input (e.g., text, images) is sent to third-party AI models to generate responses or images as requested by you. We strive to use reputable providers. <strong>Please note that content sent to these AI models may be used by the providers to improve their models.</strong> We do not transmit any personal identifiers alongside this content that would link it directly to you.</li>
        <li><strong>With Service Providers:</strong> We may engage third-party companies and individuals to facilitate our App (e.g., hosting the Cloud Run service for AI processing, analytics for anonymized usage data). These third parties have access to your information only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose.</li>
        <li><strong>For Legal Reasons:</strong> We may disclose your information if required to do so by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities.</li>
        <li><strong>Business Transfers:</strong> In connection with any merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to another company.</li>
        <li><strong>With Your Consent:</strong> We may share your information with your explicit consent.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Data Retention</h2>

    <p>We do not store your submitted text queries or uploaded images on our servers after the AI processing is complete and the response/generated image has been delivered to you, unless it is specifically part of a feature requiring persistence (e.g., if you choose to save an AI-generated image within the App, it is stored locally on your device or linked to your local App data). Anonymized usage data may be retained for app improvement.</p>

    <h2>5. Your Choices and Rights</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Data Submission:</strong> You choose what information you submit to the AI features. By submitting, you consent to its processing for the intended AI functionality.</li>
        <li><strong>Local Data:</strong> Your cat's profile and growth journal entries are primarily stored locally on your device. You can manage or delete this data directly within the App.</li>
        <li><strong>Access/Deletion:</strong> As we do not store personal data on our servers beyond immediate processing for AI requests, direct server-side access/deletion requests for specific content are not applicable to the content submitted to AI features. For any other concerns regarding data, please contact us.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Security of Your Information</h2>

    <p>We are committed to protecting the security of your information. We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your information during transmission and processing for AI features. However, no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure.</p>

    <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>

    <p>Cathena is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. If we become aware that we have collected personal data from a child under 13 without verification of parental consent, we take steps to remove that information from our servers.</p>

    <h2>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>

    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last updated" date. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>
